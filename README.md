During this project I wanted to further explore the concept of Computer Vision by, this time, building CNNs and utilising pre-trained CNNs. The dataset used for this included images of XRAYs labeled as fractured or not fractured. The pre-trained models I experimented with were the ResNet50 and VGG16. My results showed that the VGG16 model and the model I built manually both scored over 95%. However, before the testing of models, some images would return an error when recieved by the model. This was due to the fact that some images were corrupted and were not readable for the model. That meant I had to check the validity of images and filter them out before feeding them into the model.
